This needs to be run on a linux machine.

Step 1 (compile):
	run "make" from sysprof directory

Step 2 (add kernel module):
	sudo insmod sysprof.ko

Step 3 (start gather):
	cd daemon
	./gather

Step 4:
	wait


You might see some output from gather indicating progress.
After SAMPLE_SIZE (default = 1440) 10 second increments, statcalcs will be called and will produce cutoff values
After cutoff values have been produced, gather will compare them against incoming data
